Project Background

The banking institution conducts direct marketing campaigns to promote term deposit products among its existing customers. These campaigns are carried out through different communication channels such as cellular and telephone calls. Despite significant outreach efforts, the overall conversion rate for term deposit subscriptions remains relatively low, highlighting the need for a data-driven approach to improve campaign effectiveness.

The bank possesses a large volume of customer demographic, financial, and campaign interaction data, which had not been fully leveraged to understand customer behavior and conversion patterns. This project focuses on analyzing and synthesizing this data to uncover meaningful insights that can support more targeted and efficient marketing strategies.

The analysis aims to identify customer segments that are more likely to subscribe to term deposits and determine the key factors influencing successful conversions. Insights derived from this study can help optimize marketing efforts, improve customer targeting, and increase overall campaign performance.

Key areas of analysis include:

Customer Demographic Analysis: Understanding customer distribution across age groups, job roles, education levels, and financial profiles.

Campaign Performance Analysis: Evaluating how contact methods, campaign timing (monthly trends).

Financial Behavior Analysis: Assessing the relationship between account balance levels and term deposit conversions.

Historical Campaign Outcome Analysis: Analyzing the effect of previous campaign outcomes on future subscription likelihood.

Business Objective

The objective of this analysis is to identify high-potential customer segments and the key factors influencing term deposit subscription using historical customer and campaign data. By analyzing customer demographics, financial behavior, and past marketing interactions, the study aims to uncover actionable insights that can help the bank optimize customer targeting, improve campaign effectiveness, and increase overall term deposit conversion rates in future marketing campaigns.

Analysis Performed

The analysis focused on understanding customer behavior and identifying the factors that influence term deposit subscription using historical customer and campaign data. The following steps were carried out:

Prepared the data for analysis by converting call duration into a numeric format and extracting the month from the contact date.

Studied customer characteristics such as age, job role, education level, and account balance to understand the overall customer profile.

Analyzed campaign-related factors including contact method, previous campaign outcomes, and timing of customer outreach.

Compared subscription outcomes across different customer groups to identify patterns and trends.

Summarized key findings into actionable insights to support future marketing decisions.

Executive Summary

This project analyzes customer and campaign data to identify the key factors influencing term deposit subscription. The analysis reveals that customers in the working-age group, those with higher account balances, and individuals contacted through the cellular channel show a higher likelihood of subscribing. Campaign timing also plays an important role, with mid-year months generating stronger conversion outcomes. Additionally, customers with successful past campaign interactions demonstrate a significantly higher probability of future conversion. These insights can help the bank optimize customer targeting, improve campaign efficiency, and enhance overall conversion rates in future marketing initiatives.
